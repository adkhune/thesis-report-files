\usepackage{lipsum}%this package provides nonsense text for testing document layouts.  Not needed for real thesis.


% Here are the important changes:
% FIRST, go comment out the lines from \usepackage[ ... ]{natbib} through \setlength{\bibsep}{...}
% in csuthesis.cls
% ^^^ HIGHLY IMPORTANT.
\usepackage{chicago}
% this package may be outdated.  Tough luck.  
% Maybe you can find a more recent version 
% and follow my same procedure.
% To get this to compile, you'll need to find that chicago package.

% The following is copied out of... somewhere... 
% (maybe chicago package?) and modified:
\def\thebibliography#1{
	\centerline{\scshape References}
	\vspace{.5\baselineskip}
	\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{{\scshape References}}
	\list
   {[\arabic{enumi}]}{\settowidth\labelwidth{[#1]}
   \leftmargin\labelwidth
   \advance\leftmargin\labelsep
   \advance\leftmargin\bibindent
   \itemindent -\bibindent
   \listparindent \itemindent
   \parsep 0mm plus .5\baselineskip
   \usecounter{enumi}}
   \def\newblock{}
   \sloppy
   \sfcode`\.=1000\relax}
 
% Ok, that's about the end of the modifications.  Now go look at the end of this document.

\begin{document}

\frontmatter
%turns the page numbering to roman, and does some other stuff.

% \input{abstract}
\begin{abstract}
A sample abstract: \lipsum[1-2]
\end{abstract}

\begin{acknowledgements}
\lipsum[3]
\end{acknowledgements}%this is optional.  It must be declared before maketitle, a lot like abstract.  Consider having this in a separate file.

\maketitle

\tableofcontents %don't move this around too much
% \listoftables %optional, but this is the spot it should go
%\listoffigures %optional, but this is the right location for it

\mainmatter %switches page numbering to normal, resets page counter, etc.
% \include{chapter1}
%\include{chapter2}
%\include{chapter3_r}
%\include{chapter4_r}

\chapter{The only chapter}

Here's a sample sentence with a couple citations, namely number one \cite{multifrac} and number two \cite{infodim}.  Now here is a ton of filler.

\lipsum[4-5]
