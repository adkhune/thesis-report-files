Book: Mobile CLoud Computing: An Introduction (J Grover, G Kheterpal)
Computation offloading is a complex process and it is affected by different parameters such as:

User: network data cost, cloud service cost, privacy and total process execution time determine whether 
a user enables/disables computation offloading. Additionall, it also depends on what actual action
the user is perfoming- e.g. if the user is exeuting a performance intensive application, he would ideally
want to disable computation offloading.

Smartphone: Most modern-age smartphones have powerful processors, upo 1 GB of memory and ample secondary 
storage, such users are less likely to require frequent mobile cloud support as compared to users with featue phones. 

Application: if the data size is too large and application data is unavailable in the cloud, the mobile side
computation is encouraged. coz this scenario involves higer execution time and consumes high energy in terms of
communication which may negate the benefits of offloading.
